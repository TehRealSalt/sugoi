# Shut Up and Get On It (SUGOI)

SUGOI is one of the largely [Sonic Robo Blast 2](https://www.srb2.org/) mods, creating a long custom campaign out of hundreds of contributions, with most of the maps being made in a short time frame.

Currently the project is complete, and is no longer accepting new content. This repo is for bug-fixes or for maintaining for newer SRB2 versions.
